/**
 * Builds the journal-entry lines for the clearing entry that closes (fully
 * or partially) a customer invoice against an actual bank transaction.
 *
 * The lines built here are the "Inbetalning kundfaktura" path under
 * faktureringsmetoden (accrual): Dr 1930 / Cr 1510, with a 3960/7960
 * FX-diff line when the invoice and the bank tx are in different currencies.
 *
 * Shared between:
 *   - GET /api/transactions/[id]/match-invoice/preview (read-only, drives
 *     the dialog the user confirms against)
 *   - POST /api/transactions/[id]/match-invoice (the commit path)
 *
 * Single source of truth so the preview and the committed verifikat are
 * byte-identical. Earlier the two diverged on the cross-currency math:
 * the preview ran `resolveSekAmount(tx.amount, null, INV.currency, INV.rate)`,
 * treating the SEK tx number as if it were in the invoice's currency and
 * multiplying by the invoice's stored rate. That produced a fictitious
 * bank-leg amount and silently dropped the FX gain/loss.
 *
 * # Customer-invoice only
 *
 * This helper is the CUSTOMER side (kundfaktura): AR account 1510, FX gain
 * 3960 (valutakursvinster rörelsefordringar), FX loss 7960
 * (valutakursförluster rörelsefordringar), bank-leg = Dr. Supplier-side
 * settlement has the opposite DR/CR polarity (Cr 1930 / Dr 2440-series) and
 * a different account taxonomy; it lives in the match_batch_allocate RPC,
 * not here. Do not call this helper from supplier-invoice flows.
 *
 * # Currency model
 *
 *   tx.currency      : currency of the bank tx (almost always SEK)
 *   tx.amount        : amount in tx.currency
 *   tx.exchange_rate : populated at ingest only when tx.currency != SEK
 *   tx.amount_sek    : pre-computed SEK at ingest for non-SEK tx
 *   invoice.currency : currency the invoice was issued in
 *   invoice.exchange_rate: the rate at which AR was originally booked on 1510
 *
 *   Bank-leg (1930) = always the actual SEK that hit the bank.
 *   AR-leg (1510)   = the SEK value of the customer-debt reduction at the
 *                     INVOICE's stored rate (capped to bankSek on partials
 *                     to keep 1510 in sync with invoice.remaining_amount).
 *   FX diff         = (AR-leg SEK − Bank-leg SEK); sign drives 3960 vs 7960.
 *                     Per BFL 5 kap 4-5§ every verifikat must balance to the
 *                     öre; the FX diff line is what makes the cross-currency
 *                     verifikat balance. Only emitted when the bank tx fully
 *                     clears the invoice's remaining: partials defer the
 *                     FX adjustment to the final settlement to avoid
 *                     prematurely zeroing 1510 while the AR row still says
 *                     partially_paid.
